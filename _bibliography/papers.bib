  title = {Georgia’s potentials for sustainable intensification, increasing food security and rural incomes},
  journal = {Environmental Research: Food Systems},
  abstract = {Increasing global demand for agricultural commodities spurs conversions of natural ecosystems. Sustainable intensification in areas of high yield gaps has been proposed as a pathway to achieve food security, support rural livelihoods, and improve resource efficiency while also reducing the impact of commodity production by narrowing yield gaps on existing agricultural lands. Following the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Georgia experienced one of the highest losses of agricultural productivity among all former USSR countries and is now highly dependent on food imports. Closing yield gaps in Georgia through sustainable intensification has the potential to increase food self-sufficiency, support rural livelihoods, and strengthen food security and sovereignty. We estimated Georgia’s potential for sustainable intensification in current agricultural areas to achieve self-sufficiency for wheat, maize, and barley. We found that crop yields can be doubled to tripled under high-input production systems, using high-yielding varieties, optimized inputs, fertilizers, and pest control. Yet, self-sufficiency in wheat can only be reached if at least 80% of the attainable yields are achieved and if land is strategically allocated between crops. To achieve such increases, farmers need access to and training for using different crop varieties, fertilizers, and pest and disease control practices and products. Intensification with very high levels of inputs can increase the ecological and human risks of agriculture and raise equity concerns. Yet, intensifying very low input agricultural production systems is often found to be more sustainable, with high yield increases compared to limited impacts on the environment. The high employment rate in the agricultural sector in Georgia provides opportunities for intensification to help reduce poverty and improve livelihoods by increasing incomes and food security.}

  abstract = {The Caucasus Mountains harbor high concentrations of endemic species and provide an abundance of ecosystem services 
    yet are significantly understudied compared to other ecosystems in Eurasia. In the country of Georgia, at the heart of the 
    Caucasus region, forest degradation has been the largest land change process over the last thirty years. The prevailing narrative
    is that legal and illegal cutting of trees for fuelwood is primarily responsible for this process. Yet, since independence from 
    the Soviet Union in 1991, the country has undergone rapid socioeconomic and institutional changes which have not been explored as
    drivers of forest change. We combine newly available land-cover change estimates, Georgian statistical data, and historical 
    institutional change data to examine socioeconomic drivers of forest degradation. Our analysis controls for concurrent changes in
    climate that would affect degradation and examines variation at the regional (state) level from 2011 to 2019, as well as at the 
    national level from 1987 to 2019. We find that higher winter temperature and drought are associated with higher degradation at 
    the regional scale, while major institutional changes and drought are associated with higher forest degradation at the national 
    level. Access to natural gas, the major energy alternative to fuelwood, had no significant association with degradation. Our 
    results challenge the narrative that poverty and a lack of alternative energy infrastructure drive forest degradation and suggest
    that government policies banning household fuelwood cutting, including the new Forest Code of 2020, may not reduce forest 
    degradation. Given these results, improved data on wood harvesting and more research on the commercial drivers of degradation 
    and their links to economic and political reforms is needed to better inform forest policy in the region, especially given 
    ongoing risks from climate change.}
