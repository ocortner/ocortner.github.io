  abstract = {The Caucasus Mountains harbor high concentrations of endemic species and provide an abundance of ecosystem services 
    yet are significantly understudied compared to other ecosystems in Eurasia. In the country of Georgia, at the heart of the 
    Caucasus region, forest degradation has been the largest land change process over the last thirty years. The prevailing narrative
    is that legal and illegal cutting of trees for fuelwood is primarily responsible for this process. Yet, since independence from 
    the Soviet Union in 1991, the country has undergone rapid socioeconomic and institutional changes which have not been explored as
    drivers of forest change. We combine newly available land-cover change estimates, Georgian statistical data, and historical 
    institutional change data to examine socioeconomic drivers of forest degradation. Our analysis controls for concurrent changes in
    climate that would affect degradation and examines variation at the regional (state) level from 2011 to 2019, as well as at the 
    national level from 1987 to 2019. We find that higher winter temperature and drought are associated with higher degradation at 
    the regional scale, while major institutional changes and drought are associated with higher forest degradation at the national 
    level. Access to natural gas, the major energy alternative to fuelwood, had no significant association with degradation. Our 
    results challenge the narrative that poverty and a lack of alternative energy infrastructure drive forest degradation and suggest
    that government policies banning household fuelwood cutting, including the new Forest Code of 2020, may not reduce forest 
    degradation. Given these results, improved data on wood harvesting and more research on the commercial drivers of degradation 
    and their links to economic and political reforms is needed to better inform forest policy in the region, especially given 
    ongoing risks from climate change.}
